# Advent of Code 2018

Herein lies my Elixir solutions for the Advent of Code 2018 puzzles.

## Approach

My approach to each problem involves the following procedure:

1. Write an initial solution for each puzzle with no help beyond code
	 documentation.
2. Rewrite initial solutions to improve the code's readability and performance.
3. Watch Jos√© Valim (the author of Elixir) solve the solutions.
4. Refactor again, keeping the core of my solution intact (unless truly awful),
	 but applying anything interesting learned from his solution.
